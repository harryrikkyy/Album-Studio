# Todo — Phase 0: Verification foundation & CI

> Tracks the current phase only. When all are done + checkpoint passes, we write
> the Phase 1 list. Legend: [x] done · [~] needs owner input · [ ] pending.

## Tasks

- [x] **Add coverage script**
  - Acceptance: `npm run test:coverage` runs the suite + prints a coverage report.
  - Verify: command exits 0, shows a coverage summary. ✅ 70/70, 75.9% line baseline.
  - Files: `package.json`

- [x] **Add GitHub Actions CI**
  - Acceptance: workflow runs lint + typecheck + test:coverage on push/PR to `main`.
  - Verify: green run once pushed to GitHub (`harryrikkyy/Album-Studio`).
  - Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- [x] **Developer/verification guide**
  - Acceptance: a cold clone can install, run, and knows the gates + smoke-test.
  - Files: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

- [x] **Push Phase 0 to GitHub to activate CI**
  - Acceptance: CI runs on GitHub. ✅ pushed `abbf43d`.
  - Verify: Actions tab (checking).

- [x] **Commit the sample project as an E2E fixture**
  - Acceptance: a sanitized `.json` (no private paths/emails) in `e2e/fixtures/`.
  - Verify: 0 private markers, valid JSON, 15 pages. ✅ `e2e/fixtures/sample-project.json`.

- [x] **Rotate the leaked credentials (owner action)**
  - Acceptance: Google OAuth client secret + `LICENSE_SECRET_KEY` rotated; old
    `dist/` deleted. ✅ owner reset secret, new `.env`, `dist/` removed.
  - Verify: app still signs in. ✅ confirmed working (`npm start` sign-in).

## Phase 0 checkpoint — ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] CI green on GitHub (run `abbf43d` success).
- [x] `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` written; sample fixture committed.
- [x] Leaked secret rotated; compromised build removed.

→ Proceeding to Phase 1. See "Phase 1" below.

# Todo — Phase 1: Safety net (in progress)

- [x] **Playwright-Electron E2E harness + first boot test**
  - Acceptance: `npm run test:e2e` launches the app and asserts the login window.
  - Verify: green E2E job on macOS CI (Linux can't run it — app quits on non-darwin).
  - Files: `playwright.config.js`, `e2e/boot.spec.js`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json`
- [x] **Guarded test-mode + first real-flow E2E**
  - Acceptance: app skips auth in test-mode (`ALBUMSTUDIO_E2E`, dev-only + double-
    guarded by `!app.isPackaged`); E2E reaches the workspace and drives a real tab
    switch. Companion `ALBUMSTUDIO_E2E_LOGIN` forces the login path deterministically.
  - Verify: `npm run test:e2e` → 2 passed (local ✅; CI pending). Files: app.js,
    e2e/workspace.spec.js, e2e/boot.spec.js
- [ ] **E2E: heavier flows** (load sample project → undo/redo; export w/ Photoshop mocked)
  - Next: a guarded project-load hook so the fixture drives page/state/undo tests.
- [ ] **Integration tests for main-process IPC handlers** (Photoshop/fs mocked)
  - Likely needs handler logic extracted from `ipcMain.handle(...)` registration
    (dovetails with the Phase 2 module split).
- [ ] **Characterization tests for the stateful core** (history, render-queue)
  - Captures current outputs before the Phase 2 refactor touches them.
